# Hourly Preview Release of Dantotsu (Alpha)

> [!NOTE]
>
> * This repository **automatically compiles** the upstream **dev branch** of the official Dantotsu project:
>   ➡️ [https://git.rebelonion.dev/rebelonion/Dantotsu/src/branch/dev](https://git.rebelonion.dev/rebelonion/Dantotsu/src/branch/dev)
>
> * Every hour, the workflow checks for upstream commits.
>   If new changes are detected → a fresh APK is built and released.
>
> * All development is done by **rebelonion** and the official contributors.
>   This repository **does not modify any source code** — it only automates builds for quick access to the newest dev updates.
>
> * These builds are intended for **testing, previewing, and development purposes only**.

## Alpha Build Information

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * **All builds from this repository install separately as an Alpha app.**
> * The app is published under a **different name and package name** to avoid conflicts.
>
> **Alpha App Name:** `Santotsu α`
> **Package Name:** `different from official Dantotsu`
>
> ✅ This means:
>
> * You **can install Santotsu alongside the official Dantotsu app**
> * No overwrite, no uninstall required
> * Safe for parallel testing

---

## Notes

> [!WARNING]
>
> * These Alpha builds use **different signing keys** from the official Dantotsu release.
> * Releases are created **only when new upstream commits exist** (no empty builds).
> * Manual workflow triggers are supported for testing or debugging upstream changes.

## Developers

> [!TIP]
>
> * Use these Alpha APKs to quickly test **upstream dev branch changes**.

Just tell me 👍
