# Hourly Preview Release of Dantotsu (Alpha)

> [!NOTE]
>
> * This repository **automatically compiles** the upstream **dev branch** of the official Dantotsu project:
>   ➡️ [https://git.rebelonion.dev/rebelonion/Dantotsu/src/branch/dev](https://git.rebelonion.dev/rebelonion/Dantotsu/src/branch/dev)
>
> * Every hour, the workflow checks for upstream commits.
>   If new changes are detected → a fresh APK is built and released.
>
> * All development is done by **rebelonion** and the official contributors.
>   This repository **does not modify any source code** — it only automates builds for quick access to the newest dev updates.
>
> * These builds are intended for **testing, previewing, and development purposes only**.

> **Package Name:** `different from official Dantotsu`
>
> ✅ This means:
